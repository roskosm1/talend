## Quick Recap
- Migration of talent-generated Java ZIP files to a standard CI/CD process using Gradle.  
- Three-phase approach: extract code → build with Gradle → deploy to systems.  
- Repository structure: agreed on **multi-module projects** with pre-grouped ZIP files.  
- Handling multiple main classes in ZIPs requires investigation and clear documentation.  
- Deployment output formats must stay **compatible with existing systems** during migration.  
- A **dedicated testing environment** is needed to validate conversions.

## Next Steps
- **Paul**
  - Set up a call with Dima, Sergey, and Mike to discuss deployment processes.  
  - Email out the meeting transcript with links to relevant epics.  
  - Rename the team chat and add all relevant members.  

- **Denis**
  - Rewrite success criteria so jobs can be changed after redeployment.  

- **Team**
  - Investigate multiple main classes in ZIP files and determine splitting strategy.  
  - Document deployment details for Star MCs.  
  - Survey all in-scope Talent deployments to understand mechanisms.  
  - Set up regular meetings with Star MC representatives.  
  - Create tooling to map ZIP files to target repositories with configurable grouping.  

- **Sergey**
  - Convert Kotlin Gradle task to Java (if preferred).

## Topics Discussed

### 1. Java ZIP Migration to CI/CD
- Plan: move from Maven → Gradle.  
- Phases:  
  1. Extract Java code from ZIPs.  
  2. Build with Gradle.  
  3. Deploy output to Artifactory, file shares, and uDeploy.  
- Focus: repeatability, maintainability of generated code.  
- Need to **discover and document existing deployment processes** first.

### 2. Repository Structure for ZIP Files
- Agreed: use **multi-module projects** rather than one repo per ZIP.  
- Problem: some ZIPs have multiple main classes.  
- Decision: split such ZIPs into separate repos.  
- Grouping to follow MC practices, possibly via a **YAML configuration**.

### 3. Multiple Main Classes Investigation
- Denis: suspected automatic generation or orchestration usage.  
- Jan: explained SMC uses PLAN feature for orchestration.  
- Action: investigate why multipl
